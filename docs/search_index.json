["course-description.html", "Section 1 Course Description 1.1 Prerequisites 1.2 Everything is on the Web", " Section 1 Course Description PQHS 500 (cross-listed as CRSP 500 and MPHP 500 and formerly known as EPBI 500) is a one-semester advanced course in modern design and analysis of observational studies, usually in the context of comparative effectiveness research, with a special emphasis on issues that arise in clinical and health services research. An observational study is an empirical investigation of treatments, policies or exposures and the effects that they cause, but it differs from an experiment in that the investigator cannot control the assignment of treatments to subjects. This course is designed to introduce design, data collection and analysis methods appropriate for scientists engaged in observational studies, and will prepare students to design and interpret their own studies, as well as those of others in their field. Technical formalities will be minimized, and the presentations will focus on the practical application of methods and strategies. 1.1 Prerequisites People take this course with a wide range of backgrounds and a common interest in using data effectively in research related to biology or medicine. All CWRU students who feel up to it are welcome, regardless of their field of study or prior experience. Students with a working knowledge of R, multiple regression, and some familiarity with logistic regression, should be well prepared. I strongly encourage people to first complete the PQHS 431-432 sequence, or at least to be substantially familiar with the use of R and RStudio (as well as, ideally, R Markdown) on the coding side, and with multivariate regression modeling and in particular logistic regression on the statistical side. Those who are unsure if they are well prepared for the course should contact the instructor for some advice. 1.2 Everything is on the Web https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500 is the place to go for everything related to this course. Please visit any time you need something. I update the web site frequently.

His Twitter handle is @ThomasELove 2.4 A More Complete Biography Hi. I have at least three different jobs. I am a Professor in the Departments of Medicine and Population &amp; Quantitative Health Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. I teach three courses per year there: PQHS 431, 432 and 500, and also lead the Health Care Analytics track of the MS program in Biostatistics. I direct Biostatistics and Evaluation at the Center for Health Care Research &amp; Policy, which is a joint venture of CWRU and MetroHealth Medical Center. For ten years, I was the (founding) Data Director for Better Health Partnership, an alliance of people who provide, pay for and receive care in Northeast Ohio. I now serve as Chief Data Scientist there. I am a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, and have won some awards for my teaching and my research. I have been teaching at CWRU since 1994, and have taught every type of CWRU student over the years, especially graduate students in biostatistics, medicine, and management. In research, I use statistical methods to look at questions in health policy and in particular the provision of health services. I mostly work with observational data, rather than data that emerge from randomized clinical trials, and I have a special interest in working with data from electronic health records. You may be interested in a study in Health Affairs showing the impact of a Medicaid-like expansion plan on care and outcomes of poor patients in Cleveland. Or you might be interested in our New England Journal of Medicine study of the effect of electronic health records on the care and outcomes of people with diabetes. In 2011, James O’Malley and I chaired the Ninth International Conference on Health Policy Statistics, here in Cleveland. Here’s a recap. I’ve also worked on many projects involving the use of propensity scores to make causal inferences from observational studies, particularly in heart failure. I serve on an AHRQ study section which reviews research training and career development grants. If you want to see some of my publications, knock yourself out. I hold degrees from Columbia University in the City of New York and from the University of Pennsylvania. My dissertation advisor was Paul Rosenbaum. I am married to a brilliant woman and we are raising two terrific sons. The elder is a junior at the University of Pittsburgh, and the younger will study at Columbia this Fall. I live in Shaker Heights. In spare moments, I do community theater among other things. "],

He now works in the lab of Dr. Siran Koroukian, and has also worked with Dr. Love as a research intern at Better Health Partnership, and as a TA for the 431 course. He obtained his Bachelor’s degree in Health Science from DePaul University in Chicago. Before enrolling at Case, he worked at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Harry took 500 last year, and looks forward to helping you with R coding, data management, propensity score analysis and other matters.

["assignments.html", "Section 4 Assignments 4.1 Deadlines 4.2 The Course Project 4.3 An “Observational Studies in Action” presentation 4.4 Homework Assignments 4.5 Essays in reaction to the course text 4.6 A Note on Feedback 4.7 Grading", " Section 4 Assignments The four types of assignments required of you in this course are: A semester-long project An “observational studies in action” presentation Several brief “essays” about chapters in the Rosenbaum (2017) text, and Several “homework” assignments involving using R to perform and present analyses. 4.1 Deadlines All deadlines are specified on the Course Calendar. 4.2 The Course Project You will do a small observational study as a capstone project for the course. Your deliverables include: a proposal which you will submit for my approval before proceeding further. an update verifying that you have the data and are proceeding appropriately. a final presentation to the class about your results accompanied by an abstract, and by R Markdown and HTML files that describe the work you did. Complete details on the Course Project are available here. 4.3 An “Observational Studies in Action” presentation During the semester, you will be responsible for presenting the methods and results of an observational study from the literature that uses propensity scores. Your choice of manuscript must be accepted in advance by Dr. Love. After you’ve claimed a study, you’ll give a 15-minute presentation of it to the class, and you’ll also act as “second reviewer” for one of the studies selected by your colleagues. Complete details on the OSIA work are available here. 4.4 Homework Assignments Several homework assignments require you to do some analyses (using R and R Markdown) on data I will provide to you. Details on the homework assignments are available here. 4.5 Essays in reaction to the course text In most sessions, we will be reading chapters from Paul Rosenbaum’s Observation and Experiment. In early sessions, we will be reading several chapters at once (see the Schedule for up-to-date details.) Beginning with Class 4, you will produce an essay in reaction to this reading to share with the rest of the class. The essay prompts are available here. 4.6 A Note on Feedback 500 is a very different course from 431-432 in terms of the “hands on” assistance that I make available to you as you’re working on a homework assignment, in part because I don’t have a TA for the course. In particular, I’m not going to review your code to be sure you’re going in the right direction, even though I understand some of you have come to expect that from 431-432. Instead, we discuss the homework in class and I provide a detailed answer sketch after the fact. So if you have questions, please feel free to send them, and I’ll answer sometimes, but what I am likely to say to anything I cannot resolve quickly for you (or think is worthy of deeper discussion as a group) is: That sounds like an excellent question to bring up on Thursday in class, and I’m going to let you (and everyone else) flounder a bit between now and our discussion of this homework in class. 4.7 Grading If you complete all deliverables on time, and your project and OSIA presentations are solid, you will receive an A in the course. If you mostly meet that standard but don’t quite (either because more than one thing is late or because you have substantial project problems that linger), either an A or B is possible. This is an advanced graduate school course. I don’t anticipate that anyone who makes a concerted effort will fall below the B standard, as no one has in the past. If you have any concerns, raise them with me directly as soon as possible. Email is likely the best approach. "]
