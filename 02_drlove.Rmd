## A More Complete Biography

Hi. I have at least three different jobs.

- I am a Professor in the Departments of Medicine and Population & Quantitative Health Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. I teach three courses per year there: PQHS 431, 432 and 500, and also lead the Health Care Analytics track of the MS program in Biostatistics.
- I direct [Biostatistics and Evaluation](http://chrp.org/biostatistics-evaluation/) at the [Center for Health Care Research & Policy](http://chrp.org/), which is a joint venture of CWRU and MetroHealth Medical Center.
- For ten years, I was the (founding) Data Director for [Better Health Partnership](http://betterhealthpartnership.org/), an alliance of people who provide, pay for and receive care in Northeast Ohio. I now serve as Chief Data Scientist there.
- I am a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, and have won some awards for my teaching and my research. 
- I have been teaching at CWRU since 1994, and have taught every type of CWRU student over the years, especially graduate students in biostatistics, medicine, and management.

In research, I use statistical methods to look at questions in health policy and in particular the provision of health services. I mostly work with observational data, rather than data that emerge from randomized clinical trials, and I have a special interest in working with data from electronic health records.

- You may be interested in a [study in Health Affairs](http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/34/7/1121.abstract) showing the impact of a [Medicaid-like expansion plan on care and outcomes of poor patients in Cleveland](http://thedaily.case.edu/new-study-shows-prepared-safety-net-improves-care-saves-money-in-medicaid-expansion-population/).
- Or you might be interested in our [New England Journal of Medicine study](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1102519) of the effect of electronic health records on the care and outcomes of people with diabetes.
- In 2011, [James O'Malley](http://tdi.dartmouth.edu/faculty/a-james-omalley-phd) and I chaired the [Ninth International Conference on Health Policy Statistics](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/ichps/2011/index.cfm?fuseaction=main), here in Cleveland. Here's a [recap](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10742-012-0096-8). 
- I've also worked on many projects involving the use of propensity scores to make causal inferences from observational studies, particularly in heart failure.
- I serve on an [AHRQ study section](https://www.ahrq.gov/funding/process/study-section/hcrtrst.html) which reviews research training and career development grants.

I hold degrees from Columbia University in the City of New York and from the University of Pennsylvania. My dissertation advisor was Paul Rosenbaum. I am married to a brilliant woman and we are raising two terrific sons, the elder of whom is in college now. I live in Shaker Heights. In spare moments, I [do community theater](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater), and have appeared onstage with several local groups.
